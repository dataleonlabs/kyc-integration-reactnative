# Dataleon KYC Integration React Native

## Description
A brief description of your application here.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You'll also need the Expo command-line interface (expo-cli).

### Installation Steps
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/dataleonlabs/kyc-integration-reactnative.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd kyc-integration-reactnative

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or with yarn
# yarn install
npm start

A web page will open with the Expo DevTools interface. You can now choose to run your application on an emulator/simulator or on a physical device by scanning the QR code using the Expo Go app (available on the App Store or Google Play).
To run the application on an Android/iOS emulator, press the "a" or "i" key in your terminal where the Expo application is running.
